# Instance.js License

Instance.js is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later** (“AGPL-3.0-or-later”), **subject to the additional terms below**, which are imposed pursuant to **Section 7 of the AGPL** (“Additional Permissions and Conditions”).

By copying, modifying, distributing, or using Instance.js, you agree to be bound by both the AGPL-3.0-or-later and the following Additional Terms.

---

## 1. Definitions

For the purposes of this license:

* **“Instance.js”** means the software authored by Jasper Wolf (Ashraile), including all source code, object code, documentation, examples, and any derivative works thereof.
* **“Competing Framework”** means any general-purpose JavaScript UI framework, library, meta-library, meta-framework, or application framework intended for third-party application development, whether open-source or proprietary, including but not limited to React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Preact, Lit, Qwik, Nuxt, Remix, Astro, or functionally similar systems.
* **“Organization”** means any legal entity, including but not limited to corporations, partnerships, LLCs, foundations, non-profits, government entities, or unincorporated groups.
* **“Commercial Use”** means use primarily intended for, or reasonably expected to result in, direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
* **“Educational Use”** means use whose primary purpose is instruction, explanation, demonstration, or analysis, rather than the delivery of a commercial product or service.

---

## 2. Framework Integration Restriction

Notwithstanding any permissions otherwise granted under the AGPL:

> **You may not use, incorporate, adapt, extract, re-implement, or embed Instance.js source code, in whole or in part, into a Competing Framework without first obtaining a separate written commercial license from the author.**

This restriction applies regardless of whether the Competing Framework is:

* Open-source or proprietary
* Distributed free of charge or commercially
* Directly or indirectly monetized

This restriction applies to:

* Direct code inclusion
* Substantial code derivation
* Reimplementation based on Instance.js internals
* Architectural cloning intended to provide equivalent framework-level functionality

---

## 3. Large Organization Commercial Use Requirement

Organizations that **(a)** have **annual gross revenue exceeding USD $1,000,000**, **or (b)** employ **more than fifteen (15) individuals**, **must obtain a commercial license** prior to engaging in any of the following:

* Use of Instance.js in **proprietary or closed-source software** distributed to third parties
* Use of Instance.js in **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), hosted services, or cloud platforms**, beyond the standard AGPL network source-disclosure requirement
* **White-labeling, rebranding, or sublicensing** Instance.js or software substantially based upon it

### Startup and Small Team Grace

Organizations **below both thresholds** may use Instance.js under the standard AGPL-3.0-or-later **without a commercial license**.

If an organization later exceeds either threshold, continued use beyond that point requires contacting the author to obtain a commercial license. Preferential terms may be offered to early adopters.

---

## 4. Educational and Content Creation Exception

Notwithstanding Sections 2 and 3 above, the following uses are **explicitly permitted**, even when the creator or organization receives payment or generates revenue:

* Creation and distribution of educational content concerning Instance.js, including but not limited to:

  * Video tutorials, walkthroughs, courses, reaction videos, or livestreams
  * Blog posts, articles, books, documentation, or written guides
  * Free or paid workshops, training programs, or instructional materials
  * Educational websites or tools whose primary purpose is teaching or demonstrating Instance.js

* Use of Instance.js, including modified versions, **solely within such educational materials or demonstrations**

This exception applies **only where the primary purpose** of the use is educational.

### Explicit Exclusions

This exception **does not permit**:

* Incorporation of Instance.js into a Competing Framework
* Use in proprietary or closed-source applications distributed to third parties
* Use as a core component of a commercial SaaS, platform, or hosted service
* White-labeling, rebranding, or presenting Instance.js as part of another product
* Bundling Instance.js as a functional dependency of a non-educational commercial offering

All educational uses must retain all required copyright notices and attribution as required by the AGPL-3.0-or-later.

AGPL source disclosure obligations are triggered **only** where Instance.js is modified and made available to users over a network. Purely demonstrative use (e.g., videos, slides, static examples, local demonstrations) does not independently trigger disclosure obligations.

## 5. Commercial Licensing and Author Rights

Commercial licenses removing or modifying the above restrictions are available **exclusively** from the author and are payable **only via cryptocurrency**, with **USDT preferred** (SOL, BTC, and ETH also accepted).

The author:

* May evaluate requests based on intended use, scope, company, and distribution.
* Is under no obligation to grant a commercial license, particularly if presented with so-called 'bad-faith' propositions.

## 6. Non-Transferability

Any commercial license granted:

* Is **non-transferable**
* Is limited solely to the purchasing legal entity
* Does **not** extend to parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, or related entities unless explicitly agreed in writing

In the event of merger, acquisition, or change of control, continued use may require a new commercial license.
