## Additional Terms

    Integration of Instance.js (or any derivative work) into a competing general-purpose JavaScript UI framework, library, meta-library, or meta-framework (including but not limited to React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Preact, Lit, Qwik, Nuxt, Remix, Astro, etc.) requires a separate written commercial agreement.
1. **Framework Integration Restriction**  
   The use or incorporation of Instance.js source code, or any portion or modification thereof, into a competing general-purpose JavaScript UI framework, library, meta-library, or meta-framework (including but not limited to React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Preact, Lit, Qwik, Nuxt, Remix, Astro, etc.) requires a separate written commercial agreement.

2. **Large Organization Use**  
   Organizations with more than $1 million USD in annual revenue or more than 15 employees must obtain a commercial license for:  
   - Use in proprietary closed-source applications distributed to third parties  
   - Use in SaaS or hosted services (beyond AGPL’s normal network disclosure requirement)  
   - White-labeling or rebranding

3. **Educational and Content Creation Exception**  
   Notwithstanding the restrictions in Sections 1–3 above, the following uses are explicitly permitted, even when the creator or organization receives payment or generates revenue:  
   - Creating and distributing educational content about Instance.js, including but not limited to:  
     - Video tutorials, courses, or reaction videos / livestreams (e.g., on YouTube, Udemy, Twitch, TikTok, MDN)  
     - Live streaming educational sessions or coding demonstrations  
     - Blog posts, articles, books, or written guides  
     - Free or paid online courses, workshops, or training materials
     - Educational websites or tools that demonstrate or teach Instance.js  
   - Using Instance.js (including modified versions) in such educational content or demonstrations  

   This exception applies only when the primary purpose of the use is to teach, explain, demonstrate, or promote the understanding of Instance.js or related programming concepts.  

   This exception does **not** apply to:  
   - Integration of Instance.js into a competing general-purpose JavaScript UI framework  
   - Use in proprietary closed-source applications distributed to third parties  
   - Use in commercial SaaS platforms or hosted services (beyond AGPL network disclosure)  
   - White-labeling or rebranding Instance.js as part of a different product  
   - Any use where Instance.js is bundled as a core component of a non-educational commercial offering  

   Educational uses must retain all copyright notices and attribution in the Source code as required by AGPL-3.0-or-later.  
   Source code disclosure under AGPL-3.0-or-later is only required if you modify Instance.js and make the modified version available to users over a network (e.g., in a hosted web application). Purely demonstrative or local use (e.g., in videos, static demos, or local examples) does not trigger source disclosure obligations.

4. **Commercial Licenses**  
   Commercial licenses that remove the above restrictions are available exclusively via cryptocurrency payment (SOL preferred, BTC/ETH/USDT/ accepted).

   Pricing and payment details: [TBD - crypto-only]

6. **Reservation of Rights**
   The author reserves the right to refuse any commercial license offers or requests, at any price and for any reason, without explanation.

All other usage is governed solely by the AGPL-3.0-or-later.
